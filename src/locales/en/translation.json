    "bella-ext": "This project was a way into NextJS for me and the timing couldn't have been better. It was a time when client/server components and app router were not yet declared stable and production ready, so I learned pages routing and getServerSideProps data fetching. But as time passed on these previously mentioned features were declared production ready so I decided to refactor what I had around them. The app is hosted on Vercel, the database (holding restaurant menu items) as mentioned is hosted on MongoDB. This project also helped me get a much better grasp of TypeScript.",
